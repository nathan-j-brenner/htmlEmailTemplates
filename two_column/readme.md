These are four different ways to implement a responsive sidebar layout within the responsive skeleton template.

The width of the body row is defined by the max-width of the divs, and within the commented out lines for Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office, the width.  Those two values should be the same. When the screen width hits the max-width breakpoint, the elements stack, which is defined in each div with display set to inline-block.

To make the images responsive, set width to 100% and height to auto.  For best practices, use a larger image for the mobile version, and set the display to none to that larger image (see the page on the responsive_table).
